It can move a stationary object or stop a moving object. Force. In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity  Restating mathematically the definition of energy. Force is what is needed to accelerate (i.e. change the motion of) an object, according to Newton's 2nd Law: F=ma. Energy is force times distance (E=Fd), so for instance if you push a block against friction with a force of 3 newtons for a distance.
